    Creates an area for you to draw on.  The MAGICAL property this Element has is that you interact
    with the element using your own coordinate system.  This is an important point!!  YOU define where the location
    is for (0,0).  Want (0,0) to be in the middle of the graph like a math 4-quadrant graph?  No problem!  Set your
    lower left corner to be (-100,-100) and your upper right to be (100,100) and you've got yourself a graph with
    (0,0) at the center.
    One of THE coolest of the Elements.
    You can also use float values. To do so, be sure and set the float_values parameter.
    Mouse click and drag events are possible and return the (x,y) coordinates of the mouse
    Drawing primitives return an "id" that is referenced when you want to operation on that item (e.g. to erase it)

    A custom titlebar that replaces the OS provided titlebar, thus giving you control

    NOTE LINUX USERS - at the moment the minimize function is not yet working.  Windows users
    should have no problem and it should function as a normal window would.

    This titlebar is created from a row of elements that is then encapsulated into a
    one Column element which is what this Titlebar function returns to you.

    A custom titlebar removes the margins from your window.  If you want the  remainder
    of your Window to have margins, place the layout after the Titlebar into a Column and
    set the pad of that Column to the dimensions you would like your margins to have.

    The Titlebar is a COLUMN element.  You can thus call the update method for the column and
    perform operations such as making the column visible/invisible

    Works like a "print" statement but with windowing options.  Routes output to the "Debug Window"

    In addition to the normal text and background colors, you can use a "colors" tuple/string
    The "colors" or "c" parameter defines both the text and background in a single parm.
    It can be a tuple or a single single. Both text and background colors need to be specified
    colors -(str, str) or str.  A combined text/background color definition in a single parameter
    c - (str, str) - Colors tuple has format (foreground, backgrouned)
    c - str - can also be a string of the format "foreground on background"  ("white on red")
